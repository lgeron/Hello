# Hello

A Chatbot for Women's Healthcare Services

For inquiries about code please contact liams.geron@gmail.com

## APIs

The Chatbot relies heavily on several Google APIs in order to serve its functionality. You will need to sign up for these APIs in order to run the Chatbot on your end. Please inspect the tools/ folder to see how these keys are used.

A list of all APIs used:
- Google Places (https://developers.google.com/places/)
- Google Directions (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/)

## Code Style

The code style is from wit.ai's pywit, the python library for wit.ai (https://github.com/wit-ai/pywit). You can inspect either main.py or the examples/ folder in the pywit github page to see best practices for working with wit.ai's API.

Tutorials for wit.ai's GUI can be found on it's homepage (https://wit.ai/docs) where you will be able to see the basic workflow for training entities and intents. It is suggested that you do not skip this step, as it will tell you more about how the overall codebase works. 

## Login

I believe you need to use my old transcendent github account in order to access the trained wit.ai model we have going, so here is the login to that:

usrname: lgeron@t19s.com
pwd: chatbotfuntimeshello

Please if you have any questions email liams.geron@gmail.com and I'll get back to you ASAP.
